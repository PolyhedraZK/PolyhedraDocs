Can data protection controls effectively safeguard sensitive data without compromising transparency or accountability? These challenges require proof of established trust in AI systems, and protection of sensitive information on all sides.

Governments and institutions globally are working to regulate AI, visible in initiatives like the European Commission's AI Act and NIST's AI Risk Management Framework. Despite these efforts, traditional approaches often fall short as they require exposing proprietary models or sensitive data, resulting in trade-offs between security, and trust. Building from [foundational work](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf)[<a href="#ref1">1</a>], zero-knowledge machine learning[<a href="#ref2">2</a>,<a href="#ref35">35</a>] (zkML) provides a breakthrough solution by enabling mathematical verification of AI systems without revealing underlying data or models.

Polyhedra Network proposes an interoperable solution optimized for zkML technology in EXPchain, applying years of advanced [research and implementation](https://www.polyhedra.network/research)[<a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>-<a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a>-<a href="#ref24">24</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a>-<a href="#ref34">34</a>] to enable the creation of applications that verify AI behavior and compliance without revealing proprietary information. This blockchain infrastructure ensures scalable, fast, and secure verification of AI behavior and compliance across diverse use cases.

### 1.2 AI-Blockchain Convergence

The global AI market is projected to contribute up to [\$15.7 trillion](https://www.pwc.com/hu/en/pressroom/2017/ai.html)[<a href="#ref4">4</a>] to the global economy by 2030, while blockchain's potential value is estimated at [\$3.1 trillion](https://medium.com/consensys-media/gartner-blockchain-will-deliver-3-1-trillion-dollars-in-value-by-2030-d32b79c4c560)[<a href="#ref5">5</a>] over the same period. The cost of AI failures due to errors, biases, or flawed implementations is equally staggering.

In 2022 it was estimated that the cost of poor software quality in the US had grown to [at least \$2.41 trillion](https://www.it-cisq.org/the-cost-of-poor-quality-software-in-the-us-a-2022-report/)[<a href="#ref6">6</a>], with AI failures further expanding the [categories of risk](https://www.raconteur.net/technology/cost-ai-failures)[<a href="#ref7">7</a>] with incorrect outputs, data breaches and cyber attacks. Beyond financial losses, these errors often result in [harm to individuals](https://medium.com/@experiential.ai/the-extreme-costs-of-faulty-ai-and-the-vital-role-humans-play-dba1fc0971ed)[<a href="#ref8">8</a>], whether through wrongful imprisonment, misdiagnosed medical conditions, or biased decision-making. From data inputs to model outputs, ensuring every element of AI-driven transactions are verifiable and accountable is no longer optional, it's essential to navigate these risks while unlocking AI's full potential.

The convergence of AI and blockchain marks a paradigm shift in decentralized technology. While ZKPs like [Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf)[<a href="#ref9">9</a>] and [Plonk](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953)[<a href="#ref10">10</a>] have advanced scalability, practical deployment for complex AI systems remains challenging. Innovations such as the Expander proof system and [zkPyTorch](https://blog.polyhedra.network/scaling-trust-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/)[<a href="#ref11">11</a>] build on these foundations, significantly enhancing computational efficiency to enable real-time AI verification.
