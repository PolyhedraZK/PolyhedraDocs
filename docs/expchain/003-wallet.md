# Wallet Configuration

    Any Ethereum-compatible wallet can be used with the EXPchain. For example, the following section provides instructions on setting up MetaMask for EXPchain, which is the recommended wallet.

## Testnet:

- Network Name: EXPchain Testnet
- RPC URL:
  - [https://expchain.polyhedra.network/rpc0-testnet](https://expchain.polyhedra.network/rpc0-testnet)
  - [https://expchain.polyhedra.network/rpc1-testnet](https://expchain.polyhedra.network/rpc1-testnet)
- ChainID: 18880
- Symbol: tZKJ
- Explorer: [https://expchain.polyhedra.network/blockscout-testnet](https://expchain.polyhedra.network/blockscout-testnet)
- tZKJ on Sepolia: 0x465C15e9e2F3837472B0B204e955c5205270CA9E
- tZKJ on BSC Testnet: 0xbBF8F565995c3fDF890120e6AbC48c4f818b03c2

Depending on your location and preference, you can choose from a variety of RPC endpoints for EXPchain. For more information about the endpoints and their features, please refer to [the network information document](002-rpc.md) that we have prepared for you.
