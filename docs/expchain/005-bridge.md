# Bridge

Users can transfer their ZKJ tokens from Ethereum or BNB Chain to the EXPchain.

ZKJ tokens were initially issued on Ethereum and BNB Chain. To facilitate transactions on the EXPchain, these tokens can be bridged over. The ZKJ token serves as the native currency for transaction fees on the EXPchain.

**Step 1: Get some native tokens**

How to obtain:

- For the testnet, you can use the faucet to obtain test tokens. [EXPchain Testnet Faucet](https://expchain.polyhedra.network/faucet)
- For the mainnet, you can withdraw tokens directly from a centralized exchange (CEX) which supports EXPchain network(e.g. OKX).

**Step 2: Add the preferred network to your wallet**

You'll also need to add the desired chain's RPC endpoint to your wallet. Here we provide [an example](003-wallet.md) for doing this using MetaMask.

**Step 3: Initiate the deposit**

Visit [https://expchain.polyhedra.network/bridge](https://expchain.polyhedra.network/bridge) and log in with your wallet. Ensure you are connected to the correct source network before initiating the cross-chain transfer.

- Select Network: Source network:Sepolia Testnet, BSC Testnet; Destination network:EXPchain Testnet
- Enter the transfer amount.
- Confirm the recipient address.
- Click "Approve" and then "Transfer"
