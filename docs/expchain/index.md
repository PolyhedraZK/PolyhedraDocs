# About EXPchain

EXPchain, developed by the Polyhedra Network, is a groundbreaking blockchain designed to redefine the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and decentralized technologies. As the foundation of Polyhedra's vision for a trustworthy AI ecosystem, EXPchain integrates advanced zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) technology and an innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) framework. This unique combination ensures that AI applications built on EXPchain are not only scalable and efficient but also verifiable.

The global AI and blockchain markets are rapidly expanding, with projections of trillions in economic contributions by 2030. Despite this growth, challenges surrounding trust, transparency, and security persist. EXPchain addresses these concerns by enabling developers to build ethical AI systems that prioritize compliance and accountability without compromising performance.
Key features of EXPchain include:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML):** Allows cryptographic verification of AI models and processes, ensuring trust in outcomes without exposing sensitive data.
2. **Expander Proof System:** The worldâ€™s fastest zero-knowledge proof system. Sets a new benchmark for performance, enabling real-time verification of complex AI computations. Up to 1000x faster than alternative proof systems.
3. **Expanded Proof of Stake (ExPoS):** A unified consensus model leveraging zero-knowledge proofs for scalable, transparent staking across blockchains.
4. **zkPyTorch:** Seamlessly integrates zkML with the popular PyTorch AI framework, reducing development complexity and time.
5. **zkNative Blockchain Infrastructure:** Purpose-built for AI, offering unparalleled scalability, finality, and cost-efficiency.

With applications ranging from healthcare to smart cities, robotics, and finance, EXPchain provides a trusted, decentralized platform for developers to innovate responsibly. It represents a critical step toward a future where AI is not only more intelligent but also inherently secure, ethical, and aligned with human values. EXPchain is truly the "Everything Chain for AI," bridging the gap between human trust and digital innovation.
