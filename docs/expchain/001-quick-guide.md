# Quick Guide

If you're a developer interested in building applications on the EXPchain, this document provides all the essential information you'll need

## Getting Started

EXPchain is a high-performance blockchain network.

Since EXPchain is EVM-compatible, your existing Ethereum contract skills will seamlessly transfer to EXPchain.

## Connecting to EXPchain Testnet

Here are some resources to help you get connected to the EXPchain network:

- [Network Information and RPC Providers](002-rpc.md)
- [Wallet Configuration](003-wallet.md)

## Obtain Tokens

ZKJ is the native utility token of EXPchain and is used to pay transaction fees.

- [EXPchain Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.expchain.ai)
- [EXPchain Devnet Faucet](https://faucet-devnet.expchain.ai/)
- For the Mainnet, you can withdraw tokens directly from a centralized exchange (CEX) that supports the EXPchain network (e.g., OKX).

## JSON-RPC API

Interacting with EXPchain requires sending requests to specific JSON-RPC API methods. EXPchain's APIs are compatible with Geth. - [JSON-RPC API](002-rpc.md)
