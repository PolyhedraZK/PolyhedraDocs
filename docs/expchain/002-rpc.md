# JSON-RPC

JSON-RPC endpoints refers to the network location where a program could transfer its RPC requests to access server data. Once you connect a decentralized application to an RPC endpoint, you can access the functionalities of different operations, which could enable real-time usage of blockchain data. EXPchain provides several RPC endpoints for connecting into both its Mainnet and Testnet. In this section, we list the JSON-RPC endpoints that can be used for connecting to EXPchain.

## Add EXPchain Testnet with One-click

Visit the [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/chain/18880) and connect to your wallet, it will add alive RPC endpoints.

## EXPchain Testnet(ChainID 0x49c0, 18880 in decimal)
- https://expchain.polyhedra.network/rpc0-testnet
- https://expchain.polyhedra.network/rpc1-testnet

## EXPchain Devnet(ChainID 0x70D0, 28880 in decimal)
- https://rpc-devnet.expchain.ai

## Starting HTTP JSON-RPC

    You can start the HTTP JSON-RPC with the â€“http flag

    ```bash
    ## testnet
    geth attach https://expchain.polyhedra.network/rpc0-testnet
    ```
